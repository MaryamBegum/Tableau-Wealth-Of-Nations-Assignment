# 🌍 Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis 📊

In this project, I dove into the *Wealth of Nations* dataset, cleaned it up 🧹, and turned raw numbers into insightful stories through stunning visualizations 📊. Using Microsoft Excel for data wrangling and Tableau for visual storytelling, I crafted an interactive dashboard to explore economic data.


## 📊 Excel Analysis

- Data Cleaning: Removing inconsistencies, formatting, and ensuring accuracy 
- Data Visualisation: Created pivot tables and bar charts to summarise and visualise key metrics.
- Advanced Sorting: Identified the top 20 highest-ranking countries for focused analysis.
- Custom Charts: Added some flair to the visuals with colours and creative touches 

## 🎨 Tableau Dashboard
- Chart Creation: Designed six unique, visually appealing visulisations, from bar charts 📊 to dual-axis plots 📈, I pushed my Tableau skills to new heights.
- Interactivity: Enabled filtering features to make the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly for seamless exploration.
- Dashboard Design: Focused on accessibility and aesthetics, ensuring a professional and inclusive presentation.

In Tableau, I conjured up a dashboard brimming with four captivating visuals:
